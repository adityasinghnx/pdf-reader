# Generative AI PDF Reader

The Generative AI PDF Reader is a sophisticated tool designed to read multiple PDF files simultaneously and allow users to query the content within these files. This project leverages advanced technologies including FAISS, Langchain, Gemini Pro, Google Generative AI Embedding model, and Streamlit to provide a seamless and interactive experience.

## Features

- **Multi-file Reading**: Simultaneously reads and processes multiple PDF files.
- **Intelligent Querying**: Users can ask questions about the content of the PDF files and receive accurate responses.
- **High Performance**: Utilizes FAISS as a vector database for efficient indexing and querying.
- **Interactive Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly and interactive front end.

## Technologies Used

- **FAISS**: Fast and efficient similarity search and clustering.
- **Langchain**: Framework for developing applications powered by language models.
- **Gemini Pro**: High-performance computing environment.
- **Google Generative AI Embedding Model**: State-of-the-art embedding model for text representation.
- **Streamlit**: Python library for creating interactive web applications.
